# Ello Engineering Challenge

ðŸ‘‹ Hello Ello Team,

I have successfully implemented the required frontend for the challenge and integrated it with the backend. Below are the details of my implementation and the additional features I included:

- **React and Vite:** Used React as the frontend framework with Vite for fast development and build process.
- **MUI Joy:** Utilized MUI Joy for consistent and attractive UI components.
- **React Hooks:** Effectively used React hooks for state management and side effects.
- **Search Bar**: A search bar component that allows users to search for books by title.
- **Book List**: A component that displays search results, showing the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the reading list.
- **Reading List**: A component that displays the list of books added by the teacher, with a button to remove each book.

## Additional Features

- **Figma Design:** Created a design prototype using Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/9qaALwuYKxcM6t2GJjcn60/ello?node-id=0-1&t=RAYEGf2NEhLlZY9Q-1)
- **Local Storage Integration:** Implemented local storage to persist the reading list across page reloads.
- **Improved UX:** Enhanced user experience with smooth interactions and responsive design.

### Frontend Setup

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Project Structure**: Ensure your project has the following structure:

    ```css
        frontend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.jsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ vite.config.js
    ```

3. **Run**: Run the project:

    ```bash
        npm run dev
    ```

I look forward to discussing my implementation and the additional features in more detail. Thank you for the opportunity!

_This project was enjoyable!_
